The extraction pipeline's goal is to provide a *sane* way to obtain
sensible time-series datasets from the overall MIMIC database.

The goal is to perform *minimal necessary* preprocessing, such as:

* standardizing units of measure for each quantity of interest
* discarding measurements that are not clinically plausible (exceed known min/max values)
* imputing **regular-interval (hourly)** time-series from the irregular data generated by monitors, labs, etc
* standardizing representation of missing values
* discarding some columns/variables that have very little content (mostly missing)

Usage
-----
```
python mimic_direct_extraction \
    --output_dir [/path/to/output/directory/] \
    __TODO__ \
    __TODO__ \
    __TODO__ \
```

Pre Conditions
--------------
Current system has PostgreSQL version of MIMIC

Post Condition
--------------
Four primary data files are created on disk (in both .csv and .h5 format)

* **static_data[.csv/.h5]** : Static patient demographics
* * One row per (subj_id,hadm_id,icustay_id)

* **vitals_hourly_data[.csv/.h5]** : Hourly vital signs and lab values
* * One row per (subj_id,hadm_id,icustay_id,hours_in)
* * All values lie within ranges defined in __TODO__
* * Each hour's value is obtained by means of values occuring in that hour

* **outcomes_hourly_data[.csv/.h5]** : Hourly outcomes values
* * One row per (subj_id,hadm_id,icustay_id,hours_in)
* * Each hour's value is obtained by __TODO__ of values occuring in that hour

* **codes_data[.csv/.h5]** : Diagnosis codes
* * One row per (hadm_id)
